                <ul class="ps-3 pe-4">
                    <li>The legacy e-commerce platform was built on Magento 1, which was approaching end-of-life support. This created significant risks in security, performance, and scalability—necessitating a full migration to ensure long-term stability and support.</li>
                    <li>The visual design and user experience were outdated and not optimized for responsiveness or scalability. The interface failed to adapt effectively across devices and no longer reflected the brand’s evolution, resulting in a fragmented and inconsistent experience.</li>

                    <li>Enhance performance and flexibility by replacing the default Magento theme with a custom React front end integrated with the Magento 2 API—creating a faster, more adaptable, and maintainable architecture.</li>
                    <li>Optimize the user journey to increase registrations, simplify ordering, and reduce abandonment through clear information architecture and guided workflows.</li>
                    <li>Redesign the interface with a modern, responsive system that reflects the brand’s evolution and adheres to contemporary UX standards, while maintaining familiar workflows for returning users.</li>

                <p class="pe-md-3">I began by formulating key questions and conducting stakeholder interviews to establish objectives, clarify user expectations, and uncover technical constraints. From there, I defined primary user groups and their needs to guide subsequent research and design decisions. I then mapped the existing order and checkout workflows to identify usability issues and bottlenecks within the current system. Competitive research helped evaluate industry standards and best practices, providing context for improvement opportunities. Finally, I performed an in-depth review of Magento 2’s architecture and capabilities to ensure all proposed solutions were both feasible and optimized for the platform.</p>

With these personas established, I restructured the information architecture and mapped end-to-end user journeys, ensuring clarity and continuity from the homepage through order confirmation. Guided by stakeholder input and user insights, I refined the project goals to form a strategic foundation for all design and development decisions.</p>

                <p class="pe-md-3">Following strategy, I rapidly iterated on sketches to establish foundational structure, which informed the development of detailed, high-fidelity wireframes. The design focused on creating an inclusive, responsive experience that addressed all user groups, improved upon the legacy application visually, and aligned with modern trends while remaining consistent with brand guidelines. To support iteration and stakeholder alignment, I developed interactive prototypes that validated design decisions and ensured coherence with project goals and user needs.</p>

Throughout this process, I proactively integrated accessibility considerations to address usability challenges and ensure compliance with best practices. Finally, I reviewed and refined the React implementations to ensure consistency in design, usability, and accessibility across the application—delivering a cohesive, intuitive user experience.</p>
