                <p class="pe-md-3">I began by reviewing stakeholder interviews to gather context and uncover initial expectations. I then explored the legacy system in depth, mapping workflows and identifying pain points from the user’s perspective.

                <p class="pe-md-3">By combining improvement requests from the client with insights uncovered by our team, I developed a comprehensive list of project goals and enhancements. From there, I identified key users and created detailed profiles that captured their unique needs, pain points with the existing application, and objectives for resolving those challenges. Using these insights, I then mapped high-level user flows to show how modules and features interconnect, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive overall experience.</p>

                <h4 class="subtitle-sm">Design</h4>
                <p class="pe-md-3">Guided by the strategy, I designed a clean, minimal application with a scalable framework capable of efficiently presenting large volumes of data and forms. The design prioritized inclusivity, offering a seamless experience for desktop users managing data and a functional, intuitive mobile experience for onsite inspectors. I developed modular, interchangeable UX components that developers could assemble to build forms, and created interactive prototypes for complex interactions, iterating with the client based on testing and feedback.</p>

                <p class="pe-md-3">From the finalized designs, I created static, styled templates that defined the overall navigation and framework, along with modular components built to strict guidelines. This approach allowed React developers to assemble screens efficiently and accurately, using hi-fidelity wireframes in Figma as a reference. Throughout the build process, I integrated accessibility considerations into the templates to preempt common usability issues. I also reviewed and refined the React implementations, ensuring that design, usability, and accessibility remained consistent across the application, ultimately delivering a cohesive and user-friendly experience.</p>
